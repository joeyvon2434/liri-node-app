# liri-node-app
Practice using Node by making a command line app

The liri command line app takes in a few different inputs from the command line and outputs 
the requested information. The acceptable commands are:
1. my-tweets
2. spotify-this-song 'song name'
3. movie-this 'movie name'
4. do-what-it-says

For movie-this and spotify-this-song, input the movie or song name after the command. 

Purpose: This page was created to practice using node.js.

Getting Started: Clone the repo from github, set up a dotenv file with your own twitter and spotify API keys, then navigate to the folder containing the liri.js file in your terminal or bash window.

Help: Feel free to contact me with questions at joseph.vonedwins@yahoo.com

Contributors: The twitter, spotify, and OMDB APIs were instrumental in the app, all client side code was created by Joseph Von Edwins.
